# The Basis
Throwing the ideas into a file so I can clean it up.

Kanata, an elf with stark white hair and olive skin, grew up in a kingdom called Monipha. As he grew up, he was trained to fight and continue his family's history of serving in their kingdom's army.

Monipha was a kindom known for it warmongering royal family. They often would attack other kingdoms unprovoked for their land. Kanata's time in the kingdom's military was no different.

Monipha attacked a quiet woodland kingdom.
